# DevSecOps12

DevSecOpsBIU12 is a repository that contains coursework and projects from the DevSecOps course at Bar-Ilan University.

## Syllabus:
* Linux Administration
* Linux/Bash Scripting and Programming
* Git & GitHub
* Python Programming
* Docker Containers & Docker Compose
* Kubernetes
* CI/CD
* Monitoring
* Ansible
* Terraform
* AWS

Each module in the syllabus has been uploaded to the repository as its own directory.  
Each Module directory contains within itself all the relevant assignments, coursework and projects.  
  
I created this repository in order to store the knowledge learned in the course and as a way for me to learn and practice git commands.  
Whoever you are, I hope you enjoy and that it may be useful to you in some way.

Cheers.
