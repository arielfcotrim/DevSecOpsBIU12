----:: git diff ::----


*Setting VSCode as the default 'git diff tool'*

Rrun command: git config --global diff.tool vscode
Run command: git config --global difftool.vscode.cmd "code --wait --diff $LOCAL $REMOTE"

The "$LOCAL $REMOTE" part doesn't get saved for some reason
Open the .gitconfig file using the command: git config --global -e
Add the missing part and save


In order to see the diff between branches using vscode, run command: git difftool -y
